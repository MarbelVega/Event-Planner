# Event-Planner
Real-time web app to create and view events 

Run `git clone https://github.com/hasahmad/Event-Planner.git` then cd into the project directory.

Be sure to run it on a server, I recomment an easy to install `live-server`. You can install using `npm install live-server` or `npm install live-server`

Once Installed, in the project directory, run `live-server`.

Your server is now running.

Demo of the web app:
